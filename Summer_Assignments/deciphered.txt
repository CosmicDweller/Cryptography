THE SUN PEEKED THROUGH THE TALL BLADES OF GRASS AS ANTION, A YOUNG ANT, STIRRED FROM HIS TINY, HOLLOWED-OUT DIRT CHAMBER. TODAY WAS NO ORDINARY DAY. IT WAS HIS FIRST FORAGING MISSION AS A SCOUT—A BIG RESPONSIBILITY IN THE ANT COLONY, WHERE EACH ANT HAD A ROLE TO PLAY IN ENSURING THE SURVIVAL OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY.

ANTION STRETCHED HIS SIX LEGS AND SHOOK THE LAST BIT OF SLEEP FROM HIS ANTENNAE. EXCITEMENT TINGLED THROUGH HIS BODY AS HE MADE HIS WAY OUT OF THE WARM, FAMILIAR TUNNELS. WHEN HE EMERGED INTO THE OPEN, HE WAS GREETED BY THE BUSTLING SOUNDS OF THE COLONY. THOUSANDS OF ANTS WERE ALREADY MOVING IN ORGANIZED STREAMS: THE WORKERS TRANSPORTING FOOD, THE SOLDIERS GUARDING THE ENTRANCES, AND THE QUEEN’S ATTENDANTS CARING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF EGGS.

BUT TODAY, ANTION WASN’T PART OF THOSE STREAMS. HE WAS SETTING OUT ON HIS OWN ADVENTURE.

THE GRASSY EXPANSE STRETCHED IN EVERY DIRECTION LIKE AN ENDLESS JUNGLE. ANTION’S MISSION WAS CLEAR: FIND FOOD, SOMETHING UNIQUE, SOMETHING THAT COULD FEED THE COLONY FOR DAYS. HIS ANTENNAE TWITCHED AS HE SNIFFED THE AIR, SEARCHING FOR ANY SIGN OF SUSTENANCE. THE WIND BROUGHT WHISPERS OF POSSIBILITIES—SWEET NECTAR, FALLEN FRUITS, CRUMBS LEFT BY THE MYSTERIOUS GIANTS (HUMANS, AS THEY WERE CALLED).

AS HE MARCHED THROUGH THE FOREST OF GRASS, ANTION FELT AN ODD MIX OF AWE AND INTIMIDATION. EVERY LEAF, EVERY TWIG, EVERY PEBBLE WAS COLOSSAL IN COMPARISON TO HIS TINY FRAME. BUT THAT DIDN’T BOTHER HIM; HE HAD BEEN TRAINED FOR THIS MOMENT.

AFTER WHAT FELT LIKE HOURS OF SCUTTLING, ANTION NOTICED SOMETHING STRANGE. THE AIR HAD A NEW SCENT, SOMETHING RICH AND DELICIOUS, SOMETHING HE HAD NEVER SMELLED BEFORE. HE QUICKENED HIS PACE, DRIVEN BY THE INSTINCT TO FIND FOOD AND BY HIS EVER-GROWING CURIOSITY.

THE SOURCE OF THE SCENT LED HIM TO THE BASE OF A TOWERING OBJECT—A TREE. ITS BARK WAS ROUGH AND WEATHERED, STRETCHING UP INTO THE SKY. BUT THAT WASN’T WHAT INTERESTED HIM. WHAT DREW HIM IN WAS A GOLDEN, STICKY SUBSTANCE OOZING FROM A CRACK IN THE BARK: SAP.

ANTION’S ANTENNAE TWITCHED EXCITEDLY. SAP! THIS WAS PERFECT—A SWEET, ENERGY-PACKED SOURCE OF FOOD THAT THE COLONY WOULD LOVE. HE LEANED IN AND TOOK A SMALL SIP. IT WAS EVEN BETTER THAN HE’D IMAGINED! THE SWEETNESS FILLED HIM WITH ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM. HE KNEW HE HAD TO BRING THIS DISCOVERY BACK TO THE COLONY.

BUT AS HE TURNED TO LEAVE, HE NOTICED MOVEMENT OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE. A SHADOW PASSED OVER HIM, AND ANTION FROZE. HIS TRAINING KICKED IN AS HE INSTINCTIVELY PRESSED HIMSELF CLOSE TO THE GROUND. A MASSIVE CREATURE STOOD OVER HIM—A BEETLE, ITS HARD SHELL GLEAMING IN THE SUNLIGHT.

ANTION WASN’T AFRAID. HE WAS CAUTIOUS, BUT NOT FEARFUL. AFTER ALL, HE HAD FACED BIGGER CHALLENGES DURING HIS TRAINING. SLOWLY, HE INCHED AWAY, CAREFUL NOT TO DRAW THE BEETLE’S ATTENTION. HOWEVER, THE BEETLE WASN’T INTERESTED IN FIGHTING. INSTEAD, IT SEEMED TO BE DRAWN TO THE SAP, JUST LIKE ANTION HAD BEEN. ANTION WATCHED AS THE BEETLE CLAMBERED UP THE BARK, GREEDILY SIPPING THE SAP.

REALIZING HE WAS SAFE, ANTION BEGAN HIS TREK BACK TO THE COLONY. BUT SUDDENLY, A LOUD BUZZING FILLED THE AIR. ANTION LOOKED UP JUST IN TIME TO SEE A GIANT DRAGONFLY SWOOP DOWN FROM THE SKY. THE DRAGONFLY’S WINGS CUT THROUGH THE AIR LIKE SHARP BLADES, AND ITS EYES GLEAMED AS IT EYED BOTH THE BEETLE AND THE SAP.

ANTION’S HEART RACED. HE WAS SMALL, BUT HE WAS FAST. HE DARTED INTO THE THICK UNDERBRUSH JUST AS THE DRAGONFLY LUNGED FOR THE BEETLE. THE BEETLE, CAUGHT BY SURPRISE, LET OUT A LOUD HISS AND SPREAD ITS WINGS, BUT IT WAS TOO SLOW. THE DRAGONFLY’S POWERFUL JAWS CLOSED AROUND THE BEETLE’S BODY, AND WITH A QUICK SNAP, IT WAS ALL OVER.

ANTION WATCHED IN AWE FROM THE SAFETY OF HIS HIDING SPOT. NATURE WAS UNFORGIVING, HE REALIZED. THE BEETLE HAD BEEN LARGE AND STRONG, YET EVEN IT HAD FALLEN PREY TO SOMETHING FASTER AND MORE AGILE.

ONCE THE DRAGONFLY FLEW AWAY, ANTION CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY. THE SAP HAD BEEN A GOOD FIND, BUT NOW HE REALIZED HE NEEDED TO BE MORE CAUTIOUS. THE OUTSIDE WORLD WAS FULL OF DANGERS. AS HE SCURRIED BACK TOWARD THE COLONY, HE TOOK A DIFFERENT ROUTE—ONE THAT KEPT HIM CLOSE TO THE GROUND, HIDDEN AMONG THE LEAVES AND TWIGS.

AFTER A LONG JOURNEY, ANTION FINALLY REACHED THE ENTRANCE OF THE COLONY. HE WAS GREETED BY THE FAMILIAR SCENT OF HIS FELLOW ANTS AND THE COMFORTING SIGHT OF THE BUSY WORKERS MOVING IN UNISON. ANTION QUICKLY MADE HIS WAY TO THE FORAGING TEAM, HIS ANTENNAE BUZZING WITH EXCITEMENT.

“I FOUND SAP,” HE ANNOUNCED PROUDLY.

THE OLDER SCOUTS NODDED IN APPROVAL, AND THE WORKERS QUICKLY SET OFF TO FOLLOW ANTION’S TRAIL BACK TO THE TREE. ANTION FELT A SENSE OF PRIDE SWELL WITHIN HIM. HE HAD COMPLETED HIS MISSION, AND HE HAD LEARNED VALUABLE LESSONS ALONG THE WAY.

THAT NIGHT, AS ANTION SETTLED BACK INTO HIS DIRT CHAMBER, HE THOUGHT ABOUT THE DAY’S EVENTS. THE WORLD WAS VAST AND DANGEROUS, BUT IT WAS ALSO FULL OF WONDERS. EACH DAY WOULD BRING NEW ADVENTURES, NEW CHALLENGES, AND NEW DISCOVERIES.

AND ANTION, THOUGH SMALL, WAS READY FOR WHATEVER THE WORLD HAD TO OFFER.
